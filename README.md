# Data Science Projects –  2025

This repository contains a collection of practical projects completed as part of the **Data Science** course, taught by **Dr. Kheradpisheh** at **Shahid Beheshti University** during the ** 2025** semester.

Each project explores a specific aspect of the data science pipeline, from data preprocessing and analysis to visualization and predictive modeling using Python.

##  About the Course

The *Data Science* course provides both theoretical foundations and hands-on experience in the data analysis process. Topics include:

- Data collection & wrangling
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Introduction to machine learning
- Working with real-world datasets

We extensively used Python and libraries such as:

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`, `jupyter notebooks`

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized into its own folder and includes:

- ✅ Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks
- ✅ A dedicated `README.md` with project-specific instructions
- ✅ A **Farsi report** For every project, a PDF report in Farsi (Report_FA.pdf) is included. These reports walk through the code line by line, explaining concepts and logic in simple terms — ideal for Persian-speaking students and learners who want to deepen their understanding of data science.
