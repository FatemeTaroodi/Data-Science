#  Data Science – Shahid Beheshti University (Spring 2025)

> A collection of theoretical and practical projects from the **Data Science** course at Shahid Beheshti University, taught by **Dr. Khordpisheh**, Spring 2025.

This repository includes 6 main assignments combining theoretical questions, exploratory data analysis, machine learning models, and real-world datasets. The goal is to build hands-on skills while understanding core concepts such as clustering, classification, and feature engineering.

##  Project Structure

Each project consists of:

- ✅ **A practical notebook** – fully reproducible in Jupyter or Google Colab
- 🧾 **A theoretical report** – covering the conceptual background
- 📄 **A project brief** – outlining the assignment details
- 📘 **A practical PDF report** – summarizing the workflow and results (in Persian)
